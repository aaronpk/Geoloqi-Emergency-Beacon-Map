ABOUT
=====

Loqi.me allows mobile phone users to send an emergency GPS beacon to Loqi.me's 
real-time map. The location and message are sent by SMS or other networks to 
all crises group members.

Any SMS sent to the Tropo phone number with the word join is added to the crises 
response group. Any emergency GPS beacons or texts for help will be sent to all 
group members. Crises responders can also view all of the help requests on 
http://loqi.me webpage, which contains a live-updating map and stream of crises requests.

Messages can be sent and received from any platform supported by Tropo, including SMS, 
AIM, Jabber and Twitter.

This package supports multiple "groups" where each group can have its own registered
phone number and screennames. Each group is treated completely independently of the others,
so it can be used for several different cities or regions, or even for coordinating 
conference organizers.
